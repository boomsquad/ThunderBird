The program takes a github url which contains names, emails, seatnumbers, etc and parses the files and gives certain information such as if it contains an email, preferred name, first name, last name, etc. It then takes the names and displays a GUI that displays a classroom with students in certain seats. Some seats are not able to be taken and those are blacked out in the program.
